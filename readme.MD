The project was to create a webpage and I have created a site for my friend Otto Von Schirach, promoting coloring books made of images containing content related to Otto and his work as an artist.
There are 4 html pages, the first one has a navigation bar you can use to navigate throughout the website, and each page allows you to continue using the navbar to get around. The first page is an animation of Ottos triangle, here it is portrayed as a portal activator, which in the future will navigate you through the website instead of the navbar. The second page has a carousel featuring 3 coloring book pages, and the third page is a contract form in exchange for your soul. You can submit your info to formspree.io by filling out the form and submitting it after. The easter-egg page is still in the works, but will be coming soon as well.
I used HTML, CSS, Wireframes, .MD files, JavaScript, Bootstrap, .PNG 
Ideas for future improvment include, utilizing the triangle animation as a navbar, and adding a secret "Easter-egg" page.
